# What is Keras? 
* Keras Documentation : https://keras.io 
* Keras is a deep-learning framework for python that provides a convenient way to define and train almost any kind of deep learning model. 
* Compatible with Python from 2.7 to 3.6. 
* Keras allows the same code to run seamlessly on CPU and GPU. 
* API that makes it easy to quickly to prototype deep-learning models. 
* Distributed under MIT license, free for commercial projects. 
* december 2017 : 200.000 users. Used by Google, Netflix, Uber, CERN, Yelp, Square....
